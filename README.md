# Cervical Cancer Prediction

## Project Overview
Developed a machine learning model to predict the risk of cervical cancer based on patient data. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms. The XGBoost classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 97.6%, significantly aiding early detection and preventive healthcare measures.
